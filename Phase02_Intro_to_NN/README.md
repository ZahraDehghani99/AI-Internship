The purpose of this phase is to introduce neural networks and learn Pytorch framework and some simple tasks like:

1) MNIST Digits classification with Feed Forward NN

2) Heart Disease classification with Feed Forward NN

3) CIFAR-10 classification with CNN

4) Intel Image classification with CNN

5) Transfer learning for image classification on CIFAR-10

6) Name Classification using RNN

7) MNIST Digits classification using RNN, GRU and LSTM
