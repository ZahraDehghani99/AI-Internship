The purpose of this phase is to introduce neural networks and learn Pytorch framework and some simple tasks like:

1) Image classification on MNIST dataset

2) Heart disease classification

3) Image classification on CIFAR-10

4) Transfer learning for image classification on CIFAR-10

5) Using convolutional neural networks for Image classification
